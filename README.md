üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes

If you‚Äôre curious about how this works under the hood (or want to make your own version), here‚Äôs the techy bit:

    The app uses UIImagePickerController to let you pick photos from your gallery.
    Once you pick them, we use UICollectionView to display your images as a grid.
    When saving the collage, we combine all the photos into a single UIImage and save it with UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum.

üéâ Why You‚Äôll Love It

This app is simple. No ads, no confusing features‚Äîjust you and your photos. Whether you want to share memories on social media or keep them for yourself, this app makes it super easy to create something beautiful.
